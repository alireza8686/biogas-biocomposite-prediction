# Biogas Biocomposite Prediction

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository is focused on predictive modeling of biogas production from biocomposites in anaerobic digestion processes. In this project, data related to various biocomposite materials, digestion process conditions (such as temperature, pH, and retention time), and biogas production are analyzed. The aim of this project is to develop accurate predictive models to optimize the biogas production process and identify effective biocomposite materials for biogas production.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various biocomposite materials, their compositions, and the corresponding anaerobic digestion conditions such as temperature, pH, retention time, and the resulting biogas production.

## 🔧 Installation
